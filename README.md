## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test driven development is an iterative development process.

In TDD, developers write a test before they write just enough production code to fulfill that test and the subsequent refactoring. Developers use the specifications and first write test describing how the code should behave. It is a rapid cycle of testing, coding, and refactoring.

## Features

Here are the summary:

- A landing page showing Sign Up and Log In   form
- user is authenticated and able to consume the API after authentication.
